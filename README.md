# Predictive Modeling of Company Success üè≠

## Introduction

This project explores the integration of data-driven predictive models in evaluating startup success, offering an empirical approach to augment traditional venture capital decision-making.


## Project Scope

We aim to harness predictive modeling to sift through extensive datasets and unearth trends key to forecasting startup success. Our approach is data-centric, recognizing the limitations inherent in the rapidly changing startup landscape.

## Data Source

Our dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is titled 'Startup Success Prediction' and comprises 923 rows and 49 columns, focusing on aspects like funding, operations, and company status.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Standardized data formats
- Removed redundant information
- Addressed missing values

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Utilized histograms, bar charts, and geographical visualizations
- Employed libraries such as `ggplot2`, `corrplot`, `FSelector`, and `dplyr`

### Predictive Models

- **Linear and Logistic Regression**: Identified significant predictors like state variables, relationships, and company milestones.
- **Lasso and Ridge Regression**: Streamlined the feature set for improved model accuracy.
- **Random Forest and Decision Tree**: Applied for enhanced classification accuracy and model comparison.

## Key Insights

- Early funding, milestone achievements, and robust networking significantly impact startup success.
- State-specific trends (notably in California and New York) emerge as influential factors.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The project demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches in venture capital. Future enhancements will include real-time data integration and advanced AI algorithms to adapt to the evolving startup environment.
